# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the project. Whether it's fixing bugs, suggesting new
features, improving documentation, or helping with other tasks, all contributions are valuable.

## Steps to Contribute

### Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/staxys.git
```

### Create a New Branch

It's important to create a separate branch for your changes. This makes it easier to manage changes and ensures that the
main branch remains stable:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

### Make Your Changes

Implement your changes, whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or improvements to documentation. Make sure to follow the
project’s coding style guidelines and write tests if applicable.

### Test Your Changes

Make sure that the project builds correctly and all tests pass. If you’ve added new code, write tests to verify it
works.

### Commit Your Changes

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "A brief description of what this commit does"
```

### Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

### Submit a Pull Request

Open a pull request (PR) on the main repository. In the PR description, be clear about what changes you have made and
why. If your PR is addressing a specific issue, reference it using `#issue_number`.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

Follow the project’s coding style guidelines. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and other style rules as
defined in the `STYLE_GUIDELINES.md` document.

### Tests

If your change introduces new functionality, please include tests to verify your changes. If your change fixes a bug,
make sure there’s a test that reproduces the issue.

### Documentation

Please make sure that any changes to the code are reflected in the documentation. If you’re adding a new feature,
describe it in the `README` or relevant documentation files.

### Respect the Issue Tracker

If your contribution fixes an issue, reference it in your pull request description, and make sure the issue is discussed
before you start working on a fix.

### Community

Treat all contributors with respect and follow the project’s Code of Conduct. Be open to feedback and willing to work
collaboratively.

## Guidelines for New Features

If you're submitting a new feature or enhancement:

- Ensure that your feature adds value to the project and aligns with its purpose.
- Discuss large features or changes in the issues section before starting work, to gather feedback and avoid duplication
  of effort.
